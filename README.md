# Euler
Problem 1: Accidentally misread problem statement and thought it asked to INCLUDE 1000. 

Problem 2: Pretty straightforward. 

Problem 3: Wasn't particularly sure what the best way to test numbers, so I just tried out the brute force solution. Going to be going back over this one to see if we can get a better time complexity.
